# CS50
This repository contains my personal solutions for the labs and problem sets from Harvard University's CS50 course, also known as "Introduction to Computer Science". The course covers a broad range of fundamental computer science concepts, using a variety of programming languages including C, Python, JavaScript and more.

# Content
The repository is organized by week (problem sets) and labs. Each problem set and lab solution is contained in its own directory.

Please note that this content is meant for educational purposes and reference. If you're currently enrolled in the course, I highly encourage you to try and solve the problem sets yourself before referring to these solutions.

Since I am using my own vscode environment, please refer to https://github.com/cs50/libcs50/issues/189 to add cs50.h to your local environment or use Github cs50 dev

Feel free to ask me any questions, it helps us get better together!
